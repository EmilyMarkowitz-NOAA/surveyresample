# Purpose

The 'get prediction grid' script should be run before running other scripts. Use the 'pull data' file or go to the 'data' folder to get the data we are working with then run the 'main' file. Other scripts provide supporting functions that are run in the 'main' file. Due to the high number of species, effort scenarios, and replicates, the script is very computationally intensive. Reduce the number of species/effort scenarios/replicates when testing.

> This repository is under active development and all code, results, and other materials should be considered preliminary. Find code used for various versions in the [releases](`r paste0(link_repo, "/releases")` section for finalized products and project milestones.

# Installation notes

```{r install, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
devtools::install_github("nmfs-ost/surveyresamplr", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

Windows will not update a package already loaded, so then you have to remove the package and install it from scratch. There are two suggested packages, ‘graph’ and ‘Rgraphviz’, that are on Bioconductor, and you can install those with:

```{r also-install, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
install.packages("INLA",repos=c(getOption("repos"), INLA="https://inla.r-inla-download.org/R/stable"), dep=TRUE)
inla.upgrade() # for the stable version

if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install(c("graph", "Rgraphviz"), dep=TRUE)


options(repos=c( inlabruorg = "https://inlabru-org.r-universe.dev", INLA = "https://inla.r-inla-download.org/R/testing", CRAN = "https://cran.rstudio.com") )
install.packages("fmesher")
```
