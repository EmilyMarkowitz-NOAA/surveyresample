This repository is under active development and all code, results, and other materials should be considered preliminary. 

Use the 'pull data' file or go to the 'data' folder to get the data we are working with then run the 'main' file. Other scripts provide supporting functions that are run in the 'main' file. Due to the high number of species, effort scenarios, and replicates, the script is very computationally intensive. Reduce the number of species/effort scenarios/replicates when testing.
