#' @title AFSC length (size) estimate data
#' @description The final, validated survey data are publicly accessible soon after surveys are completed on the Fisheries One Stop Shop (FOSS) platform. This data includes catch, haul, and environmental data collected at each station. On the FOSS data platform, users can interactively select, view, and download data. Descriptive documentation and user-examples are available on the metadata page.

#' \describe{
#'   \item{\code{species_code}}{Taxon scientific name. The species code of the organism associated with the common_name and scientific_name columns.}
#'   \item{\code{year}}{Survey year. Year the observation (survey) was collected.}
#'   \item{\code{population_count}}{Estimated population. The estimated population caught in the survey for a species, group, or total for a given survey.}
#'   \item{\code{survey_definition_id}}{Survey ID. The survey definition ID key code is an integer that uniquely identifies a survey region/survey design. The column survey_definition_id is associated with the srvy and survey columns. }
#'   \item{\code{area_id}}{Area ID. Area ID key code for each statistical area used to produce production estimates (e.g., biomass, population, age comps, length comps). Each area ID is unique within each survey.}#'   }
